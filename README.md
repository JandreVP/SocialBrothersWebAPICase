How to compile:
----------------------------------
Pull the code from the Github repository
and Run the project in Visual Studio 2022.

Build status:
-----------------------------------
-no errors
-The Distance calculation controller
does not work properly I have doen a lot of 
research on the Distance calculation Api 
and tried different approaches to make
it work and i think I am very close but
if I had more time I would have made It work. 
_____________WARNING______________________
If Message Pops up while you run the program
that want to correct the address.db file click
on "NO" because it will corrupt the Sqlite 
Database file.

---------------------------------
Code Style:

-------------------------------
How to use:
-------------------------------
When you run the project a Swagger interface will appear in a web browser With
4 Titles AddressCRUD, FilterAscending, FilterDescending, SearchByName(These are the parts that I am proud of
and with a little more time I would have been able to Figure the Distance calculator out but I did add the code
that was thinking of how to do it I think there is something wrong with the Api key.... )

The AddressCRUD Controller is where the user will eb able to:
1. get all of the addresses in the database[Get]
2.  record Addresses and the Owners of theses addresses[post]
3. Edit a record[put](Remember to add the ID number when editing)
4. get a adrress by entering the ID [get id]
5. Delete a record [Delete]

Then the FilterAscending Controller:
  Is where the user will be able to sort the data Alphabetically in Ascending order

Then the FilterDescending Controller:
  Is where the user will be able to sort the data Alphabetically in Descending order

And the SearchByName Controller is where:
  The user will be able to search for the owner of an address or just a Letter in the Owners name.
